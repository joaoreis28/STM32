# STM32 Projects Repository

Welcome to the **STM32 Projects Repository**! ðŸš€ This repository contains projects developed using **STM32 microcontroller boards** and the **STM32CubeIDE**. The goal is to learn and explore the world of embedded systems and microcontroller programming.

## About the Repository

This repository is a personal collection of projects designed to:
- Understand the fundamentals of embedded systems.
- Learn and experiment with **STM32 microcontrollers**.
- Develop skills in using **STM32CubeIDE** for programming and debugging.
- Create a reference for others interested in STM32 development.

Each project will be accompanied by detailed explanations, code, and necessary configurations to help replicate or adapt the work.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Microcontroller:** STM32 Nucleo-L476RG
- **IDE:** STM32CubeIDE
- **Programming Language:** C/C++
- **Libraries:** STM32 HAL/LL Drivers (Hardware Abstraction Layer/Low Layer)
